# TicketShow

A ticket booking platform built using Flask and it's extensions for SQLite and REST APIs.

## How to run the application
1. Open the terminal at the root folder
2. If there is no folder in the root directory by the name `.env`, create a virtual environment for the project to run in and install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`. The following methods can be used to execute this step:
    - **For *nix system users**, to do it **manually**, execute the following commands in the given order:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    - **For Windows users**, the setup can be done manually by using the following commands in the given order:
    ```powershell
    python3 -m venv .env
    .\env\Scripts\activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Source the virtual environment in the terminal using either of the following methods:
    - **For *nix system users**, to complete this and the next step, it can be completed **manually** by running either of the following commands:
        - `source .env/bin/activate`
        - `. .env/bin/activate`
    - **For Windows users**, running the following command in the terminal should suffice: `.env\Scripts\activate`

4. Run the `main.py` file using the following command: `python main.py`
